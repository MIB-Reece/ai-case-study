## Recommendations

BlackRock is relying on AI is not open sourced and this can have a negative limit on the data the AI sources from.
I recommend that the company finds ways for their exclusive AI to evolve by collecting more data.
They could consider expanding their clientele or integrating public sources to improve their machine learning algorithim.
This AI improvement could happen through the use of chatbots and public surverys aimed to benefit the companys private clients.
Carefully planned surverys and chatbots would appropriately improve BlackRock's large language model.
